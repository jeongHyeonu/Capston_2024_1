URP in Three Simple Steps (or, how to avoid the Missing Magenta Texture of Doom)

1. Ensure your project is using the Universal Render Pipeline. If the file 'GlassURP' in the Materials folder looks like a piece of paper with a folded corner, it's not URP

2. Click the arrow to the right of the Shader Graph 'GlassURP' in the Materials folder and drag the material (looks like a shiny clear sphere) to the model (either a mesh from the 'Meshes' folder or one of your own)

3. After a brief loading period, it should display as expected (contact me [uas.bubba@gmail.com] if not)
